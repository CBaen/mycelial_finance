Mycelial Finance: A Framework for Decentralized, Recursive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Algorithmic Trading

Abstract: This report proposes a novel multi-agent system (MAS) architecture for high-frequency cryptocurrency trading, designed around the core concepts of "mycelial" peer-to-peer (P2P) learning and "recursive" game-theoretic reasoning. This decentralized paradigm is contrasted with traditional Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems (HMAS), highlighting its potential for superior resilience and adaptability in volatile financial markets. Agent interactions within the network are defined as a cooperative, general-sum game. The "recursive thought process" is computationally modeled as the learning of Stackelberg best-response policies, enabling agents to anticipate and learn from their peers. The core learning engine is a novel hybrid architecture: Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) facilitates the "mycelial" (P2P) policy sharing, while Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN) are employed to solve the multi-agent credit assignment problem. A practical software blueprint is presented based on the Mesa (Python) agent-based modeling framework, utilizing a Redis backbone for high-throughput data streaming (Redis Streams), inter-agent communication (Redis Pub/Sub), and agent-state persistence. Finally, the system's economic viability is analyzed via a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) implementation profile targeting the Kraken Pro exchange, followed by a rigorous assessment of the systemic and regulatory risks inherent in such a design.



Part 1: The Mycelial Paradigm: Beyond Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems

1.1 Defining the Mycelial Metaphor: A P2P Learning Network

The conceptual framework for this system is drawn from the "mycelial" metaphor, inspired by the function of fungal networks in an ecosystem. In practical application, this metaphor is analogous to peer-to-peer (P2P) learning networks observed in fields such as land management and agriculture. Research into these human networks demonstrates that P2P learning—where practitioners (e.g., landowners, farmers) share experiential knowledge directly—creates a highly effective, resilient, and adaptive educational framework. Participants share examples of good management, creating a collective ownership and a "sacred manner that honors... regenerative farming".



Translating this to computational architecture, "mycelial" formally refers to a decentralized, resilient, and adaptive network of autonomous agents. In this paradigm, agents share information, strategies, and policy updates directly with one another (peer-to-peer) rather than routing all information through a central controller or "orchestrator" agent.



1.2 The Antithesis: Limitations of Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems (HMAS)

The "mycelial" paradigm stands in direct contrast to traditional Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems (HMAS). An HMAS is defined by a "tree-like" architecture, where high-level "leader" agents interpret broad objectives, formulate plans, and delegate specific subtasks to specialized "sub-agents". This structure is effective for task decomposition, such as a top-level "orchestrator" agent managing warehouse inventory by delegating tasks to mid-level "zone manager" agents, who in turn command low-level "robot controller" agents.



However, the primary failure case of HMAS is its inherent "brittleness". Over-centralization, where strategic decisions are concentrated in a few top-level agents, creates critical single points of failure. The failure of a single "orchestrator" agent can halt the entire system. This characteristic is unacceptable in a 24/7/365, high-stakes financial market, which is subject to extreme volatility and "flash crash" events.



The "mycelial" design is not merely an architectural preference; it is an implicit, high-level design requirement for systemic resilience. The decentralized P2P structure, by its very nature, lacks a single point of failure. This fault tolerance makes the mycelial paradigm a superior architectural choice for a system that must maintain high uptime and adapt to unpredictable market conditions.



1.3 The Foundation: Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE)

The "mycelial" trading system is a practical implementation of a model from the scientific field of Agent-Based Computational Economics (ACE). ACE is the computational study of economies modeled as "complex adaptive systems" composed of "autonomous interacting agents".



The ACE methodology is distinct from traditional, top-down economic modeling. It focuses on capturing "emergent properties"—macro-level phenomena that are "not properties of the individual units themselves". In an ACE model, "local interactions give rise to macroeconomic regularities". This provides a "bottom-up" approach to understanding complex dynamics.



The proposed system applies this principle directly. The goal is not to program a singular, top-down macro-strategy. Instead, the objective is to design individual agents whose local, P2P interactions (the "mycelial" learning) lead to an emergent and adaptive macro-strategy that generates profit. The system is designed to learn its own collective behavior from the bottom up.



Part 2: The Cognitive Core: Game Theory and Recursive Reasoning

2.1 Defining the Recursive Thought Process

The system's design requires that agents, upon "touching," engage in a "recursive thought process" to share information and learn. This concept has a precise definition in academic literature on strategic bargaining and game theory. It is not simply a complex, multi-step calculation , but rather a specific mode of strategic, multi-agent reasoning.



As defined in studies of strategic games, a recursive thought process is one where "each player considers what other players will do, what other players think they themselves will do, and so on, potentially ad infinitum". This is a "recursive reasoning equilibrium" , where an agent models the reasoning process of its counterparts. This type of reasoning is computationally modeled in game theory and is directly applicable to financial markets, particularly in high-frequency trading (HFT), where agents must anticipate the actions of other market participants.



2.2 Modeling Agent Interaction: A Cooperative General-Sum Game

To model this recursive reasoning, the nature of the "game" the agents are playing must be defined. The agents within the "mycelial" network are not in a zero-sum game with each other. A zero-sum game would imply that for one agent to win, another must lose, which is antithetical to the "mycelial" goal of mutual learning.



Instead, the agents are a team with a "fully cooperative" objective. The entire system is in a competitive, likely zero-sum game against the external market and other HFT firms. But internally, the agents engage in a "cooperative, general-sum game". Their goal is to maximize a joint team reward (i.e., total portfolio profit). The "mycelial" sharing, where agents "suggest and help them learn," is an explicitly cooperative action designed to improve the team's collective outcome.



2.3 The Computational Mechanism: Learning Best-Response Policies

The "recursive thought process" can be computationally achieved by agents learning to model the best-response policies of their peers.



When an agent (Agent A) "touches" another agent (Agent B), it must "see patterns" (User Query), which requires Agent A to model Agent B's strategy. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), this is complex, as Agent B's strategy is also constantly changing, creating a "non-stationary" environment.



A solution to this non-stationarity, outlined in recent decentralized MARL research, is for Agent A to model the best-response policy of Agent B, conditioned on its own (Agent A's) policy. This approach is a direct application of Stackelberg equilibria from game theory. The "recursive thought process" is, therefore, the agent's internal, learned Stackelberg model of its peers.



This mechanism allows for a "fully decentralized learning scheme". Agent A does not need a central controller to tell it what Agent B is doing. Instead, it "anticipates" Agent B's best response to its own actions, fulfilling the "recursive thought" requirement. Agent A can then "suggest" (by publishing its own policy) and "help learn" (by providing a model that Agent B can use to find its best response).



Part 3: The Learning Engine: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)

To build a system of agents that learn cooperatively and decentrally, a MARL engine must overcome several fundamental challenges.



3.1 The Core Challenges of Decentralized MARL

Non-Stationarity: This is the most significant challenge in MARL. In single-agent RL, the environment is "stationary" (its rules do not change). In MARL, each learning agent is part of the environment for all other agents. As they all update their policies simultaneously, the environment becomes non-stationary, which breaks the core Markov property assumption upon which most RL algorithms are built.



The Multi-Agent Credit Assignment Problem: In a cooperative game, agents receive a shared, "sparse and delayed" team reward. If a 10-agent team executes a joint trade and it is profitable, how is that reward "assigned" to the 10 individual actions that led to it?. Failure to solve this "ambiguous credit assignment" can lead to "lazy agents" (agents who learn to do nothing, as they get rewarded anyway) or incorrect, suboptimal policy updates.



Scalability: The joint action-state space grows exponentially with the number of agents. A system with 10 agents, each having 3 possible actions, has 3

10

joint actions. A centralized controller that attempts to model this entire space becomes computationally intractable very quickly.



3.2 Solution 1 (The "Mycelial" Network): Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL)

The macro-architecture proposed for P2P learning is Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL).



Mechanism: FRL provides a framework for multiple systems to "learn together – without sharing their private data". As described in , this process is analogous to multiple hedge funds collaborating to build a better predictive model:



A global model is shared.



Each institution (or, in this case, each agent) trains the model locally on its own private data (e.g., its unique market observations, its private trading history).



Instead of sharing this sensitive data, the agent shares only the model updates (e.g., policy weights, gradients) back to its peers.



These updates are aggregated to improve the collective model.



This FRL framework is the ideal implementation of the "mycelial" concept. It is a "decentralized MARL" approach that allows agents to "share their information and learn from each other" (User Query) without a central data repository. This maintains the "privacy" of each agent's local observations (protecting its "alpha") while ensuring the entire network benefits from collective intelligence.



3.3 Solution 2 (Credit Assignment): Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN)

To solve the credit assignment problem within cooperative agent groups, this framework will incorporate Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN). VDN is an architecture explicitly designed to address credit assignment and scalability challenges , and its application in HFT strategy optimization has been academically validated.



Mechanism: VDN architecture learns to decompose the joint team value function (which is intractable) into a sum of individual, agent-wise value functions. The joint action-value function Q

tot

​

(s,a) is assumed to be the sum of individual agent value functions Q

i

​

(s

i

​

,a

i

​

), where each agent's function Q

i

​

depends only on its own local observation s

i

​

and action a

i

​

.



This allows for a "centralized training, decentralized execution" (CTDE) paradigm. During training, the system can use the sum Q

tot

​

to calculate the joint team reward and backpropagate gradients. But during execution, each agent can simply select the action that maximizes its own learned Q

i

​

function, which it can compute using only its local information. This elegantly solves the credit assignment problem by creating an implicit, learned reward signal for each agent.



3.4 Solution 3 (Coordination): The HAVEN Framework

While FRL provides the network and VDN provides the local learning logic, a lightweight mechanism is needed for high-level coordination. For this, the HAVEN (Hierarchical Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Dual Coordination) framework is proposed.



Mechanism: HAVEN is a "value decomposition framework... for fully cooperative multi-agent problems". Inspired by the human nervous system, it addresses instability from concurrent optimization by introducing a "dual coordination mechanism" of "inter-level and inter-agent strategies". This is implemented by designing reward functions within a "two-level hierarchy". This structure can be used to manage system-wide risk (e.g., a "risk manager" agent at a higher level) or capital allocation without imposing the rigid, brittle structure of a full HMAS.



3.5 Architectural Synthesis

The proposed system is a novel hybrid architecture that addresses all core challenges:



Macro-Layer (The Mycelial Network): Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) provides the decentralized, P2P policy-sharing network.



Micro-Layer (The Cognitive Core): Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN) operate within agents (or ad-hoc groups) to solve the credit assignment problem during cooperative tasks.



Coordination Layer (The "Leader"): A lightweight HAVEN framework provides high-level risk management and strategic coordination without the brittleness of HMAS.



Part 4: Architectural Blueprint: The "Mesa-Redis" System Backbone

4.1 The Agent & Simulation Layer: Python Mesa

The system's agents will be implemented as Python classes using the Mesa framework. Mesa is a "Python-based framework for building multi-agent systems" and is an ideal Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) tool for this project.



The use of Mesa serves two critical functions:



Live Agent Deployment: The mesa.Agent class provides the scaffolding for live trading agents, each with its own internal state, logic core, and memory.



Market Simulation: Mesa is designed for building ACE simulations. This simulation environment is not optional; it is a critical component for training the MARL models and, as discussed in Part 7, for conducting essential risk analysis before live deployment.



4.2 The "Nervous System": Redis as a Unified Data Backbone

To achieve the high-speed, low-latency performance required for HFT, a specialized data backbone is required. This system will use Redis as a unified "nervous system" for all real-time data persistence, streaming, and communication.



This backbone is architected in three layers:



Layer 1: Market Data Ingestion (Redis Streams) All incoming market data (trades, order book updates) will be captured in Redis Streams. A Redis Stream is an append-only log data structure, ideal for high-throughput, real-time event sourcing and sensor monitoring. This creates a persistent, replayable log of market events that multiple agents can consume independently at their own pace (using consumer groups). This is far more robust than a simple Pub/Sub model for market data.



Layer 2: Inter-Agent Communication (Redis Pub/Sub) This layer is the physical implementation of the "mycelial network." When agents "touch" to share policies or "suggest" new strategies, they will do so by publishing and subscribing to dedicated channels using Redis Pub/Sub. This provides a fast, "fire-and-forget" messaging bus for the FRL policy updates and P2P communication.



Layer 3: Agent State & Memory (Redis Key-Value) For HFT, decision-making logic must have microsecond-level access to its own state and short-term memory. Agents will use the standard Redis Key-Value store for storing their internal state, logs, and short-term contextual memory.



4.3 System Architecture Diagram (Conceptual)

This Mesa-Redis architecture can be visualized as follows:



External: Exchange APIs (e.g., Kraken) provide WebSocket/REST data.



Ingestion: A data-ingestion service pushes all market events into Redis Streams.



Processing: Mesa Agent Processes (running in containerized environments like Docker/Kubernetes ) subscribe to the Redis Streams.



State: Agents read/write their internal state and short-term memory to the Redis Key-Value store.



Mycelial Comms: Agents share FRL policy updates and coordinate via Redis Pub/Sub.



Execution: Agents send trade orders back to the Exchange API.



Part 5: Comparative Analysis: Existing Bot Architectures

The proposed hybrid-MARL architecture is novel and should be contrasted with existing open-source systems.



5.1 Monolithic Bots: Freqtrade

Freqtrade is a popular, free, and open-source crypto trading bot written in Python. Its architecture is fundamentally single-agent and single-strategy. Its "learning" capability is limited to strategy parameter optimization using its Hyperopt module. It does not perform reinforcement learning, only parameter tuning on historical data. Freqtrade is a strong baseline for implementing a single agent's trading logic but lacks any of the requested multi-agent, P2P, or recursive learning capabilities.



5.2 Frameworks: Hummingbot

Hummingbot is an open-source framework for building and running automated trading bots, with a strong focus on market making and arbitrage strategies. It is designed to provide the tools—specifically, the exchange connectors and strategy skeletons. It does not, by default, include the intelligence. The user is responsible for implementing the learning paradigm. Hummingbot provides the "plumbing" (e.g., a Kraken connector ), but not the "brain" (the "mycelial" MARL engine).



5.3 Hierarchical Agent Systems (Assembly Line): PrimoAgent

PrimoAgent is a multi-agent system for stock analysis that uses LangGraph for agent orchestration. Its architecture is a "Sequential Pipeline Design". It functions as a rigid "assembly line" where each agent performs a specialized task in a fixed order: 1. Data Collection -> 2. Technical Analysis -> 3. News Intelligence -> 4. Portfolio Manager. This is multi-agent, but it is not "mycelial." It is a top-down, linear workflow with no P2P learning or recursive reasoning between agents.



5.4 Hierarchical Agent Systems (Hedge Fund Model): arXiv 2501.00826

This paper describes an advanced LLM-powered multi-agent system for crypto portfolio management. This system appears similar, as it uses "expert agents" grouped into "teams" (Data, Market, Crypto, Trading) and features "intrateam" and "interteam" collaboration.



However, the distinction is critical. This model's collaboration is structurally defined and hierarchical. It uses a "sequential flow" where interteam collaboration is a fixed mechanism (e.g., the "Crypto team" is explicitly designed to receive memory from the "Market team"). This architecture represents a "Hierarchical Hedge Fund" model, akin to a corporate organizational chart.



The "mycelial" framework proposed in this report is fundamentally different. It is not a fixed org chart but a true network. The FRL model allows for emergent and ad-hoc collaboration. Any agent can, in principle, "touch" and share policies with any other agent, regardless of specialization, allowing for the discovery of novel, cross-functional strategies. This decentralized intelligence network directly matches the user's novel "mycelial" request, distinguishing it from existing hierarchical models.



Part 6: The Market Interface: A High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Implementation Profile

The system's design—emphasizing low-latency, high-speed communication, and rapid adaptive learning—is the definition of a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) system. Its purpose is to create a "mycelial" network that can collectively find and exploit micro-second arbitrage opportunities or act as a high-volume market maker.



6.1 Target Exchange Analysis: Kraken Pro

The Kraken exchange is selected as the target for this profile due to its robust, well-documented API , clear fee structures, and explicit support for institutional and high-volume traders.



Account Requirements: To achieve the performance necessary for HFT, the system will require a "Pro Personal" or "Business" account. These account tiers are necessary to access the "Higher API limits" that are essential for a multi-agent HFT strategy. Verification for these levels typically requires submitting a valid ID, proof of address, and occupation information.



API Rate Limits: The system's operational ceiling is defined by Kraken's API rate limits. These limits are not based on a fixed number of calls per second, but on a "counter" that increases with orders and decays over time. The Pro tier provides a significant advantage, as shown below. This limit is the primary bottleneck and dictates the maximum number of actions the entire agent collective can take per second.



Table 1: Kraken API Trading Rate Limits



Account Tier Rate Counter Threshold Decay Rate (points/sec)

Intermediate 125 2.34

Pro 180 3.75

Data synthesized from.





Fee Structure and Profit Motive: The primary reward function for the MARL agents will be defined by the exchange's fee structure. Kraken Pro uses a tiered maker-taker fee model that heavily incentivizes high-volume liquidity providers (makers).



A "maker" order adds liquidity to the order book (e.g., a limit order that does not immediately fill). A "taker" order removes liquidity (e.g., a market order). As shown in Table 2, low-volume "takers" are heavily penalized with a 0.40% fee, while high-volume "makers" (over $10M in 30-day volume) pay 0.00%. Other HFT-focused exchanges even offer maker rebates (negative fees), paying liquidity providers.



The economic goal of the entire MARL system is, therefore, to learn a collective strategy that operates as a high-volume maker, minimizing (or, on other exchanges, reversing) transaction fees. This defines the primary objective of the joint-reward function.



Table 2: Kraken Pro Spot Trading Fee Schedule (Maker-Taker)



30-Day Volume (USD) Maker Fee (%) Taker Fee (%)

$0 + 0.25% 0.40%

$50,000 + 0.14% 0.24%

$1,000,000 + 0.06% 0.16%

$5,000,000 + 0.02% 0.12%

$10,000,000 + 0.00% 0.10%

$100,000,000 + 0.00% 0.08%

Data synthesized from.





6.2 Infrastructure Requirements: Speed and Co-location

HFT is a "race for microseconds". To successfully operate as a maker, the system's limit orders must be placed on the order book faster than competitors. This requires ultra-low-latency infrastructure.



The gold standard for achieving this speed is co-location: physically placing the trading servers in the same data center as the exchange's matching engine. This reduces network latency from milliseconds to microseconds.



As major financial exchanges (like Nasdaq) and data providers (like Bloomberg) increasingly move to the cloud , "co-location" now often means deploying servers within the same cloud (e.g., AWS) region and Availability Zone as the exchange. The deployment strategy for this system must involve identifying Kraken's cloud provider and region and deploying the Kubernetes cluster running the Mesa-Redis system in that exact location.



Part 7: Operational & Regulatory Risk Assessment

7.1 The Regulatory Landscape: SEC, CFTC, and FINRA

While algorithmic trading is legal in the US , the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is fragmented, complex, and rapidly evolving.



Agency Jurisdiction: Both the SEC (which regulates assets deemed securities) and the CFTC (which regulates assets deemed commodities) claim jurisdiction, often simultaneously.



Anti-Fraud: The FTC is actively prosecuting fraudulent or deceptive crypto trading bots that make unfounded claims of big returns. The system must never be marketed with guaranteed returns.



Illegal Manipulation: The agents must be explicitly programmed to avoid illegal manipulative behaviors such as "spoofing" (placing orders with the intent to cancel them) or wash trading.



Developer Liability: Crucially, FINRA rules (such as Rule 1032(f)) require the registration of "Associated Persons involved in the design, development or significant modification of algorithmic trading strategies". This has direct legal implications for the development team itself.



7.2 Systemic Risk: The "Mycelial" Dilemma (Flash Crashes and Policy Contagion)

HFT systems are a known contributor to market volatility and "flash crash" events, where algorithms create a "negative feedback loop" that can collapse a market in minutes.



The system's greatest strength—its decentralized "mycelial" P2P learning network—is also its greatest systemic risk. The FRL architecture (Part 3) is designed for the rapid propagation of successful policies. A critical risk emerges: what happens if one agent "learns" a highly profitable but "toxic" policy?



This "toxic" policy could be:



An illegal strategy (e.g., it learns a pattern that mimics "spoofing" ).



A strategy that exploits a bug in the exchange's API.



A strategy that is highly profitable in low volatility but catastrophically unstable during a high-volatility event, amplifying a flash crash.



In a traditional HMAS, this error could be caught by a top-level "risk manager" agent. But in the "mycelial" FRL network, this toxic policy could be identified as "highly successful" and be instantly propagated to all other agents in the network. This creates a "policy contagion" that could amplify a single agent's error into a system-wide failure, a massive financial loss, or a coordinated (and illegal) manipulative event. The decentralized learning network, if not properly constrained, acts as a systemic risk amplifier.



7.3 Risk Mitigation: The Primacy of Simulation (The "ACE" Solution)

The risk of "policy contagion" makes the Mesa simulation environment (from Part 4) the most critical component of the entire system. These emergent, destabilizing behaviors cannot be tested on a live market.



The solution is to leverage the ACE (Agent-Based Computational Economics) model to its full potential. The academic literature explicitly supports using agent-based models to simulate cryptocurrency market manipulation , the impact of "fraudulent agent[s]" , and the emergent properties of agent interaction.



The primary risk mitigation strategy is, therefore, to use the Mesa simulation to run extensive adversarial tests:



Inject Toxic Agents: Intentionally introduce "bad" agents with known manipulative or unstable policies into the simulation.



Study Contagion: Observe the "mycelial" FRL network. Does the toxic policy spread? How quickly?



Tune Coordination: Use these simulation results to tune the HAVEN (Part 3.4) coordination layer, programming risk-averse reward functions that penalize high-volatility or manipulative-looking strategies, even if they are momentarily profitable.



The system must be proven to be stable in simulation before it is ever connected to a live exchange, even in dry-run mode.



Part 8: Research Roadmap and Strategic Recommendations

A phased approach is recommended to develop and deploy this system safely.



Phase 1: Environment & Scaffolding



Setup IDE: Configure the development environment, specifically VS Code for Python agent development.



Generate Baselines: Use Large Language Models (e.g., Claude) with targeted prompts to generate baseline Python code for Mesa agents.



Bootstrap Strategies: Generate simple, single-agent strategies. This can be accelerated by adapting open-source Freqtrade strategies to run within a Mesa agent class.



Phase 2: Simulation & Visualization



Build ACE Environment: Construct the ACE market simulation environment using Mesa. This should model order books, latency, and exchange-specific rules (e.g., Kraken's rate limits).



Build Dashboard: Develop a Plotly Dash dashboard to visualize agent interactions, portfolio value, and market dynamics in real-time within the simulation. This is crucial for debugging emergent behaviors.



Phase 3: Backbone & Intelligence Implementation



Implement Redis: Deploy the Redis backbone: Streams for market data , Pub/Sub for inter-agent communication , and Key-Value for agent state.



Implement MARL: Implement the hybrid FRL/VDN/HAVEN learning engines (Part 3) and integrate them with the Mesa agents.



Phase 4: Adversarial Simulation & Risk Validation (Critical Step)



Run Adversarial Tests: As detailed in 7.3, conduct extensive simulations to test for emergent manipulative behaviors and "policy contagion" risks.



Iterate and Harden: Use simulation results to refine the HAVEN coordination layer and the base reward functions to ensure system stability.



Phase 5: Deployment & Live Testing



Acquire Credentials: Secure a Kraken Pro or Business account and generate API keys.



Deploy: Deploy the containerized system to a "cloud co-located" environment to minimize latency.



Dry-Run: Connect to the Kraken API and run in dry-run mode (simulated trades on the live feed) for an extended period (weeks or months).



Live Test: Begin live-money trading with strictly limited capital. Monitor performance 24/7, cross-referencing live results with simulated performance to detect any divergence or unexpected agent behavior.
